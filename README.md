# Store Time

This is a silly little application that showcases some React/Flux usage with a Django Rest Framework API as the backend.

It creates a queue for user's that signup to track when they "go to" a convenience store and how much they've paid.

It also has a very silly mechanism for tracking daily flatulence and giving useful graphs relative to potential GI tract health.
